## Docker Image

You can pull docker image of this project `docker pull ellephy/react-apps:sportsstore`.

Don't forget to install docker first, guy. ðŸ˜ƒ [Docker's here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) ðŸ‘ˆ

## Personal Advices

In case of implementing the project from scratch, use `apollo-client` instead of `apollo-react`.
And, it would be better to use `yarn` than `npm` whenver you are stuck with version conflicts such as webpack.
