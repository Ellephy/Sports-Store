# Personal React project

This project was inspired by `Pro React 16` book.

## Personal Advices

Use `apollo-client` instead of `apollo-react`.

And, it would be better to use `yarn` than `npm` whenver you are stuck with version conflicts such as webpack.

## Docker Image

You can pull docker image of this project  `docker pull ellephy/react-apps:sportsstore`. 
And run `docker run -p 80:80 ellephy/react-apps:sportsstore`.
Don't forget to install docker first, guy. ðŸ˜ƒ
